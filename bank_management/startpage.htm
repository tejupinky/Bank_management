In this project I tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic functionality of a Bank Account Management System. To develop a project for solving financial applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of an end banking user by providing various ways to perform banking tasks. Also to enable the user’s work space to have additional functionalities which are not provided under a conventional banking project. 

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Bank Account Management System undertaken as a project is based on relevant technologies. The main aim of this project is to develop software for Bank Account Management System. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is not possible with the manuals systems, which are overcome by this software.  
The Bank Account Management System undertaken as a project is based on relevant technologies. The main aim of this project is to develop software for Bank Account Management System. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is not possible with the manuals systems, which are overcome by this software. Bank is the place where customers feel the sense of safety for their property. In the bank, customers deposit and withdraw their money. Transaction of money also is a part where customer takes shelter of the bank. Now to keep the belief and trust of customers, there is the positive need for management of the bank, which can handle all this with comfort and ease. Smooth and efficient management affects the satisfaction of the customers and staff members, indirectly. And of course, it encourages management committee in taking some needed decision for future enhancement of the bank. Now a days, managing a bank is tedious job upto certain limit. So software that reduces the work is essential. Also today’s world is a genuine computer world and is getting faster and faster day-by-day. Thus, considering above necessities, the software for bank management has became necessary which would be useful in managing the bank more efficiently.

-Our software will perform and fulfill all the tasks that any customer would desire.
-Our motto is to develop a software program for managing the entire bank process related to customer accounts, employee accounts and to keep each every track about their property and their various transaction processes efficiently.
-Hereby, our main objective is the customer’s satisfaction considering today’s faster world.
